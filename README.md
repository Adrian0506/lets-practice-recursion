# Let's Practice Recursion

This repo is still in development, but it's ready to be used in its current state to help you practice your recursion skills!

## How to Use This Repo

From your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therobinkim/lets-practice-recursion.git
cd lets-practice-recursion
```

Open up your favorite text editor from that directory.

Open up `treebar.md` to look at the setup and prompts. Run your code as you see fit, whether it's as a Google Chrome Snippet, via `node`, or REPLs like https://jsfiddle.net/.

## Future Development:

[x] Publish a set of prompts
[ ] Create more prompts:
  [ ] Treebar: `every()`, where `every(one, v => typeof v === 'number')` is `true`
[ ] Create a testing suite
[ ] Create solutions
[ ] Identify and explain common misconceptions about recursion
  [ ] "I can't use any loops"
[ ] Mention that anything that can be done iteratively can be done recursively and vice versa
[ ] Add "how to solve prompts recursively"
